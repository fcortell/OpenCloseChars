# OpenCloseChars
Finished code test from live code challenge interview.

The test consists in validate an input string where we will receive `(`, `{`, `[` and their respective closing chars mixed up. 

Validation should pass only if we find a closing char corresponding to last opening char found, before open a new different pair.
